Sinatra Project (PetBooK)
  My project is meant to be a way to allow shelter owners to create posts for their shelters so that other owners or potentially people can see how many of each pet they have at the shelter.Each post will have information such as shleter owner name, shelter location, number of dogs, number of cats, and number of birds. Anyone can create an account and view anyones posts but they can only edit their own posts.
